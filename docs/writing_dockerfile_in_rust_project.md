# Writing dockerfile in rust project
When you writing a rust project, maybe you want to build a small runtime container, then you can run it in k8s or something else you like.

Here it's my journey about writing rust project dockerfile result in a small runtime image(***alpine based***).

## TL;DR
[Here](#6-final-dockerfile) is the final dockerfile example, you can just take it and customize to what you want.

## Vendor based dockerfile
### 1. setup base image
Fortunally, we have some very useful base image for rust, you can find [rust](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust) image if your project is compiled in stable rust.  If you want to build with nightly rust, here is [nightly rust image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rustlang/rust) you can use directly.

So, let's start with it:
```dockerfile
FROM rust:latest

WORKDIR /app
```

Or nightly rust:
```dockerfile
FROM rustlang/rust:nightly

WORKDIR /app
```

Because I want it to run inside alpine, I can directly use *alpine* directly.  So the dockerfile can be this:
```dockerfile
FROM rust:alpine3.14

WORKDIR /app
```

Or nightly rust:
```dockerfile
FROM rustlang/rust:nightly-alpine

WORKDIR /app
```

*alpine* relative image contains rust *x86_64-unknown-linux-musl* target, we can use it directly to compile our code.

### 2. install musl-tools
It's also recommended to install `musl-tools` to make many crates (like textwrap) compile successfully.
```shell
apk add musl-dev
```

So, let's just add it to our dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM rust:alpine3.14

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk add musl-dev
```

### 3. make up vendor locally
[cargo vendor](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html) can vendor all dependencies locally, when you compile your project, `cargo` don't need to `update crates.io` and `download dependency code` again, so we can take less build time.
```shell
cargo vendor
```

After running cargo vendor, it will show up some messages like this:

```text
To use vendored sources, add this to your .cargo/config.toml for this project:

[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "vendored-sources"

[source.vendored-sources]
directory = "vendor"
```

Just follow it, please note that the `.cargo` is located in your project root, rather than `$HOME/.cargo`.

Note: personally, I don't want to make output `vendor` directory to be tracked by `git`.  Because it can easily be too large, just make up vendor locally is ok.

### 4. setup our source code and compile.
In this stage you just need to copy your source code, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, vendor to build directory:
```dockerfile
COPY ./.cargo .cargo
COPY ./vendor vendor
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
COPY ./src src

# build with x86_64-unknown-linux-musl to make it runs on alpine.
RUN cargo install --path . --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Here is a big shortcoming: in vendor based approach, if I change source code, the whole dependency needs to be compiled again, which can cause a lot of compile time.  So we would like to make use of docker cache, what we can do is:
1. create an empty project, compile only dependency, then,
2. remove the dummy empty project, copy our source code to working directory, then,
3. build the project.

Here is dockerfile:
```dockerfile

FROM rust:alpine3.14

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk add musl-dev

# create a new empty project
RUN cargo init

COPY ./.cargo .cargo
COPY ./vendor vendor
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
# build dependencies, when my source code changes, this build can be cached, we don't need to compile dependency again.
RUN cargo build
# remove the dummy build.
RUN cargo clean -p $project_name_specified_in_cargo

COPY ./src src

# build with x86_64-unknown-linux-musl to make it runs on alpine.
RUN cargo install --path . --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

### 5. make runtime image smaller
So here, everything can be done for now.  But I want to make up my runtime image smaller, this image is bacally too large (1G+).  So we can use [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), and copy our final binary to new base image.
```dockerfile
FROM rustlang:latest as builder
...
...
RUN cargo install --path . --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# second stage.
FROM alpine:3.14
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/cargo/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```

### 6. Final dockerfile
Ok, everything is done, here is final working dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM rust:alpine3.14 as builder

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk add musl-dev

# create a new empty project
RUN cargo init

COPY ./.cargo .cargo
COPY ./vendor vendor
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
# build dependencies, when my source code changes, this build can be cached, we don't need to compile dependency again.
RUN cargo build
# remove the dummy build.
RUN cargo clean -p $project_name_specified_in_cargo

# build with x86_64-unknown-linux-musl to make it run with alpine.
RUN cargo install --path . --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# second stage.
FROM alpine:3.14
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/cargo/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```

### 7. Additional dockerfile
Thanks for [trusch2](https://www.reddit.com/user/trusch2/) comment on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/pz2pxn/simple_intro_about_writing_dockerfile_in_rust/), we can use gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11 to have a small runtime on debian image.

The benefit trusch2 mention about using gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11 are:
- its small (~20MB)
- there is no shell and nothing else an attacker could use when trying to escape the container
- you can just build within a normal debian env and then use cc-debian11 as base without the dance around using libmusl instead of libc.

So, here is another final dockerfile based on debian:
```dockerfile
FROM rust:latest as builder

WORKDIR /app

# create a new empty project
RUN cargo init

COPY ./.cargo .cargo
COPY ./vendor vendor
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
# build dependencies, when my source code changes, this build can be cached, we don't need to compile dependency again.
RUN cargo build
# remove the dummy build.
RUN cargo clean -p $project_name_specified_in_cargo

RUN cargo install --path .

# second stage.
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/cargo/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```

### Restriction
This vendor based doesn't work well in workspace based project.  For non vendor based approach, [cargo chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef) is a valuable thing to consider.

## Not vendor based dockerfile based on cargo-chef
[cargo-chef](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-chef) can Cache the dependencies of your Rust project and speed up your Docker builds.  The page also gives us a very good documentation about how to write `cargo-chef` based dockerfile.

Here is the final dockerfile which uses `cargo-chef`:
```dockerfile
FROM rustlang/rust:latest AS chef
# We only pay the installation cost once,
# it will be cached from the second build onwards
RUN cargo install cargo-chef

WORKDIR app

FROM chef AS planner
COPY . .
RUN cargo chef prepare --recipe-path recipe.json

FROM chef AS builder
COPY --from=planner /app/recipe.json recipe.json
# Build dependencies - this is the caching Docker layer!
RUN cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe.json

# Build application
COPY . .
RUN cargo install --path .

# We do not need the Rust toolchain to run the binary!
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/cargo/bin/* /usr/local/bin
```

### Extras (only needs when your network to crates.io is too slow)
When your network to `crates.io` is too slow, you can use a custom crates.io source.  To do this, create a file in the project root directory `.cargo/cargo.toml`.  Like I'm in China, I can use tuna source instead of `crates.io` source.

Fill the `.cargo/cargo.toml` file like this:
```toml
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "tuna"

[source.tuna]
registry = "https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/crates.io-index.git"
```

Then just change your dockerfile a little:
```dockerfile
FROM rustlang/rust:latest AS chef

COPY ./.cargo .cargo
# We only pay the installation cost once,
# it will be cached from the second build onwards
RUN cargo install cargo-chef

...
...
...
```
